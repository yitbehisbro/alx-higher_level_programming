<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Python Scripts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allowed editors: <code>vi</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code></li>
<li>All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)</li>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
<li>The first line of all your files should be exactly <code>#!/usr/bin/python3</code></li>
<li>A <code>README.md</code> file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository</li>
<li>A <code>README.md</code> file, at the root of the folder of <em>this</em> project, is mandatory</li>
<li>Your code should use the pycodestyle (version <code>2.8.*</code>)</li>
<li>All your files must be executable</li>
<li>The length of your files will be tested using <code>wc</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Shell Scripts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allowed editors: <code>vi</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code></li>
<li>All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
<li>All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (<code>wc -l file</code> should print 2)</li>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
<li>The first line of all your files should be exactly <code>#!/bin/bash</code></li>
<li>All your files must be executable</li>
</ul>

<h3>C Scripts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Allowed editors: <code>vi</code>, <code>vim</code>, <code>emacs</code></li>
<li>All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89</li>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
<li>Your code should use the <code>Betty</code> style. It will be checked using <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl" title="betty-style.pl" target="_blank">betty-style.pl</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl" title="betty-doc.pl" target="_blank">betty-doc.pl</a></li>
<li>You are not allowed to use global variables</li>
<li>No more than 5 functions per file</li>
<li>In the following examples, the <code>main.c</code> files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own <code>main.c</code> files at compilation. Our <code>main.c</code> files might be different from the one shown in the examples</li>
<li>The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called <code>lists.h</code></li>
<li>Don’t forget to push your header file</li>
<li>All your header files should be include guarded</li>
</ul>

<h3>Zen</h3>

<pre><code>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
